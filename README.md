### Emotion Detection


Testing

   The model was tested with sample images. It can be seen below:

   <img src="./Test_Images/happy.jpg" alt="index1" height="300px"/>
   <img src="./Test_Images/neutral.jpg" alt="index2" height="300px"/>
    <img src="./Test_Images/suprise.jpg" alt="index3" height="300px"/>

#### The model will be able to detect 7 types of emotions:-
 #####  Angry , Sad ,  Neutral ,  Disgust ,  Surprise ,  Fear  , and   Happy

## Usage:

### For  Face Detection, and Emotion Detection Code
